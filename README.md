# python-web-matplotlib-box-graph

## Description
A demo of creating a box graph.

A box plot gives you a simple overview of five of the most important values in statistics: Minimum value, first quartile (Q 1), median, third quartile (Q 3) and maximum value. Between the first and third quartiles you draw a box. The opposite sides represent the quartiles. You draw a line through the middle of the box, representing the median.
